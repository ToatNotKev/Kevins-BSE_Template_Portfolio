# Magical Mirror!
My project is the magic mirror wich has a two way plastic mirror with a monitor behind connected to a rasberry pie with the magic mirror software downloaded onto it, it will be in my bathroom and it has faetures like showing my calender or the time, also at the bottom it displays news. Some big hurdles I have encountered where mostly on the sofware side ofthings but the mirror I had is was damaged when heat was applied to it whilst trying to fix some scratches so a new one was needed. But now a protective plastice will be put infront of it.

# First Milestone
I succeeded in getting the code to run the magic mirror software on my Raspberry Pi 4. But before this, I had to install the thirty-two-bit raspberry pi os onto a micro sd card and a student named Hari downloaded the os on the micro sd card so props to him.  After installing the os I ran some commands on the raspberry pi terminal to download the files to install the magic mirror software. These commands were the following, "git clone https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror" which retrieves all the file data from git and then after running the command "cd MAgicMirror/" to store all that information onto a file with that name. Then you tell the computer to install all that data by saying "npm run install-mm" After this, you have all this data on your Rasberry Pi you have to get it from the configuration file which contains all Magic Mirrors software code. That is done by entering "cp config/config.js.sample config/config.js" finally you tell the computer to use all that data and use it, in other words, we tell the software to boot up by entering "npm run start".

# Starter Project 

For my starter project, I chose the useless box. A device whose sole purpose is to turn itself off is referred to as a useless machine or useless box, in which the object’s only purpose is to turn itself off by activating its own “off” switch when powered. I chose the useless box because it looked interesting and I wanted to figure out how the little arm came out of the box and turned the switch off. There is a little led that turns green when the arm is coming out and red when it flips the switch off. Inside the box, there is a servo that is attached to the arm powered by three triple batteries. The arm has extra material at the end which hits a switch when in its off position. Some challenges when making the useless box were getting all the box walls is aligned with the top of the useless box

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
