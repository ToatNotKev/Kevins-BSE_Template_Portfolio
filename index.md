# Magical Mirror!
My project is the magic mirror wich has a two way plastic mirror with a monitor behind connected to a rasberry pie with the magic mirror software downloaded onto it, it will be in my bathroom and it has faetures like showing my calender or the time, also at the bottom it displays news. Some big hurdles I have encountered where mostly on the sofware side ofthings but the mirror I had is was damaged when heat was applied to it whilst trying to fix some scratches so a new one was needed. But now a protective plastice will be put infront of it.

# First Milestone
I succeeded in getting the code to run the magic mirror software on my raspberry Pi 4. But before this, I had to install the thirty-two-bit raspberry pi os onto a micro sd card and a student named Hari downloaded the os on the micro sd card so props to him.Â  After installing the os I ran some commands on the raspberry pi to basically download the files to install the magic mirror software

# Starter Project 
I made a useless box. It has a motor in it witch turns off a switch that you turn on and the motor spins a arm that opens the box

<!---# Code 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
