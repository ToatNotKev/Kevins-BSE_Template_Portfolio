# Magical Mirror!
My project is the magic mirror wich has a two way plastic mirror with a monitor behind connected to a rasberry pie with the magic mirror software downloaded onto it. Some big hurdles I have encountered where mostly on the sofware side ofthings but the mirror I had is was damaged when heat was applied to it whilst trying to fix some scratches so a new one was needed. But now a protective plastice will be put infront of it.
